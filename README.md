# QuadTreeRs

This is my attempts getting my head wrapped around using rust. I'm porting over a small project I had been working on 3 years ago to make a very simplicitic (not realistic) 2D internal combustion engine simulator. 

I think the eventual goal of this project will be to create an idiomatic implementation of a quad tree and rust and provide some visualization likely through some web interface. This may evolve into using wasm or using some web server crates as more experience.
